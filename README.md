## Requirements

### Yarn

I recommand to use `yarn` as package manager (https://yarnpkg.com).
You can install it with `npm install -g yarn`.

## Usage

### Set up your environment

Create a `.env` file from `.env.example` at the root of the repository and fill it.

### Install dependencies

Just run the command `yarn installation` at the root of the repository.

### Start the application

When your environment is set up, you can run the command `yarn start` to start the application.

### Stop the application

Just run the command `yarn stop` and it will stop the application.
